Been working at Microsoft for a while. Currently, I'm a dev lead on the Windows Azure Web Sites team, and having a blast doing that!

My team is lucky enough to be able to do most of its development as OSS, as part of [Project Kudu](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu).

Outside of work, I've recently started running, and I'm hoping to run a half-marathon later this in 2014. I've essentially *never* run before in my life, so it's a pretty big lifestyle change.

I also play some table tennis; well enough to beat most casual players, and poorly enough to get soundly beaten by much older dudes when I step into a club.
